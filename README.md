# Mulberry

Mulberry takes content from your filesystem and turns it into a working mobile app
on Android and iOS. It also provides a local development server for testing
your app, and a framework for adding custom functionality and CSS.

## Support

- [Documentation](https://github.com/toura/mulberry/wiki)
- [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/toura-mulberry)
- #touramulberry on irc.freenode.net: A live chat room with Mulberry users and
  developers. Use your own IRC client or [use Freenode's webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/)

# Installation

- Clone this repository to a location of your choosing.

    `git clone git@github.com:Toura/mulberry.git`

- Add the full path to `mulberry/bin` to your path by editing your profile and
  adding the following:

	`export PATH=$PATH:/full/path/to/mulberry/mulberry/bin`

For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/projects/mulberry`, you
would add the following to your `.profile` file.

    export PATH=$PATH:/Users/yourusername/projects/mulberry/mulberry/bin

- Install bundler if it is not already installed (note that you will need to
   have [rubygems](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3) installed; it is
   installed by default on OSX):

    `sudo gem install bundler`

- From the *root directory of the repository*, run the following command:

    `bundle install --without test development`

- You're done! You should now be able to run mulberry from any directory.

Note: As you can infer from the `bundle install` command above, this does not
install any libraries for you to do development on Mulberry core, or run any of
the automated tests. If you wish to do these things, simply re-run the bundle
install command, omitting the `--without` flag:

	bundle install

This will install the necessary libraries for ruby development and for running
the automated test suite.


# Setup

Mulberry currently supports the following mobile platforms:

- iOS4 and above on iPhone and iPad
- Android 2.2 and above on Phone only

Mulberry apps have been shown to run on WebOS, although not bug-free.

Mulberry apps do not support Windows Mobile or BlackBerry in any version.

Mulberry development tools are supported on the following platforms:

- OSX Snow Leopard and Lion

Mulberry development is not supported on Linux, but it might work. Please let
us know at mulberry@toura.com if you can get it working on a particular Linux distro.

We do not currently support running Mulberry on Windows or any other OS;
however, some work has been done to get it working on Windows -- additional
pull requests welcome!


## Installing PhoneGap

Mulberry supports PhoneGap 1.1. Any other version will not work.

Go to [the PhoneGap download page](https://github.com/callback/phonegap/zipball/1.1.0)
and download the 1.1.0 release. Extract it to a convenient directory.


### Installing iOS Phonegap Library

In the extracted phonegap directory, go into iOS, and run the installer.
The xcode project will call the lib that is installed to your computer.


### Installing Droidgap

You do not need to install droidgap as the Android project template included in
Mulberry already contains the compiled results.


## iOS Development

To build and run apps on iOS Simulator, you must:

- Own an Intel Mac running OSX Snow Leopard or Lion

- Download Xcode 4.1 or greater (preferably 4.2) from the
   [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12)


In order to submit your apps to the Apple iOS App Store, you must
[sign up with Apple's iOS Developer Program](http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/)

## Android Development

To build and run apps on Android Simulator, you must:

- Install Java JDK 1.6 or above. This should install the java compiler (javac -version should return 1.6.x)

- You may have to install Apache ant (`which ant`). We develop with ant 1.8.x (ant -version)
   http://ant.apache.org

- Download [Android SDK package](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) for your platform

- On OSX, extract it to `/Developer/SDKs/android-sdk-mac_x86/`. If you do not
   place it in this directory, Mulberry _should_ detect the location of it, but
   this is the preferred location.

- Edit your shell's loading files (`.bashrc` or `.bash\_profile` for bash and
   `.zshrc` for zsh) and add a line similar to:

	  `export PATH=$PATH:/Developer/SDKs/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools:/Developer/SDKs/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools`

- Open a new teminal and run the SDK manager:

	  `android`

- Click "Available packages"

- Expand "Android Repository"

  You should install:

  - "Android SDK Tools" (latest revision)
  - "Android SDK Platform-tools" (latest revision)
  - SDK Platform Android 2.2, 2.3.x, 2.n (up to latest revision)
  - SDK Platform Android 3.x

  Expand "Third party Add-ons", then install:

  - Google APIs 8, 9 (up to latest revision)

  Be careful, as some tools require certain revisions, so if you see
  "Skipping 'X'; it depends on 'Y'" you'll have to go back and choose X again.

  Keep doing this until you've installed everything.

- You do not need, but may choose, to install the Samples and Documentation.
It's pretty useless and just takes up space.


### Creating an Android Virtual Device

Run the SDK manager by running `android` on the command line.

- On the "Virtual Devices" section click the "New..." button

- Name the device

- Select the Google APIs - API Level 8 (to test 2.2) as the target

- Make the SD card size 64 MB

- Click "Create AVD"

Now you can run the device by running `emulator @your-device-name -partition-size 128`

To rotate the device hit 7 or 9 on your numeric keypad. If you don't have one:
CTRL-F12 to rotate to landscape, CTRL-F11 to rotate back.


### Installing to your Android Virtual Device

Start the emulator, then type:

	  adb install -r /path/to/your.apk

# TODOs

See the github issues list https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/issues/

# Running the tests


Note that if you've been following along, you have not installed the libraries
to do testing. Run `bundle install` to install the test/development libraries necessary
for testing.

To run the tests, run `rake` from the root of the repository.

You can also run individual suites:

    rake spec             # run the ruby tests
    rake evergreen:run    # run the javascript tests
    rake evergreen:serve  # serve the javascript tests for manual testing
    rake jshint           # run jshint on the js code and js tests

## Installing chromedriver

You will need chromedriver in order to run the JavaScript tests. You can
[download chromedriver](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list)
if you do not already have it installed; make sure you install it somewhere in your $PATH.

OSX users with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) installed can just `brew install chromedriver`.
